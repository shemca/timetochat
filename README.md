Dev Notes:

Built using ROR v6 for backend, Vue.JS for frontend through webpack. VueJS files can be found in the folder app/javascript.

Issues, things I would have continued work on.

Used a ROR backend, was going for a vue.js frontend through webpack. 

What was giving me trouble was integrating a vue.js form to send back a submit method correctly back to rails the message contents. Would have put more time to get that connecting properly.

Was sort of getting instant updates for new messages properly working thorugh websockets/Actioncable, however, trying to integrate actioncable with vue.js would require a bit more time.

As a result of sinking in time trying to get the vuejs form integration, did not get to work on the styling of the components. i.e: green for users text.

Also, this delayed getting the like button to work, as it was wrapped up in that form.

Would have spent more time on styling, font, UI.

First day of getting this test, the NPM site was giving 404's on files that had the name 'error' in it. So, could not get a new node_module installation working for the project until the next day, so only had 24 hours, instead of 48 hours to complete.

Took risk trying to have ROR and Vuejs connect through webpacker, second time would have used ROR as an API, and Nuxt/vuejs for the front end.
